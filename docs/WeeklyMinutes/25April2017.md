      * [Release note](http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2017/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-25th.html)

   * ITB and internal services OS updates 
   
### This Week
   * Production release
      * Display, OIM, TX updates
      * Production OS Updates

## Production Support (Ken)
   * Successful tests in ITB for DUNE at Sheffield and Imperial with glexec off
   * Working on coming up with a more general solution to the CILogon Basic CA acceptance issue at EGI
      * A more general solution besides whitelisting FNAL is nicer since it might affect LIGO down the road.
   * LSST collaborators at BNL are trying to run some workflows with PanDA; have been asking for the pilot role in the OSG VO. Mats and I are keeping an eye on them as needed.
   * Progress on the IF and CF annual report sections coming soon. Honest.
