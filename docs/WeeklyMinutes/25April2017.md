## Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * ATLAS production status: 
     * USATLAS total production over the past week was overall stable, at the average level of 60-70K running job slots.
     * Some issue from OSG->GOC interface, when ggus ticket was updated and closed, but it didn't propagate to the corresponding GOC ticket (is not showing that message and the ticket is still open): https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&ticket_id=127791 , https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=33517. In the ticket I notices this strange sounding state "Status Engineering", which was also there with the previous issues from the interface.
        * Created Jira Ticket - https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GOCTX-42
   * Job Statistics: 
     * gracc reported 1.6M pilots, 4.6M walltime hours, cpu/walltime ratio of 92% (single core jobs)
     * ATLAS dashboard reported 2m jobs (44k ran on opportunistic resources)
     
## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya)

   * 19M opportunistic wall hours for fermilab VOs, 18% of all FIFE jobs.
   
## CMS (Krista)
   * CMS Production for the past 7 days:
      * 13.16 million hours
      * 325k pilots

### Last Week
   * Production release
      * [Release note](http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2017/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-25th.html)
   * MyOSG updates have already been done on April 18th to accomodate gratiaweb retirement.  Accounting and reports are moving from FNAL and IU to UNL
   * ITB and internal services OS updates 
   
### This Week
   * Production release
      * Display, OIM, TX updates
      * Production OS Updates

## Production Support (Ken)
   * Successful tests in ITB for DUNE at Sheffield and Imperial with glexec off
   * Working on coming up with a more general solution to the CILogon Basic CA acceptance issue at EGI
      * A more general solution besides whitelisting FNAL is nicer since it might affect LIGO down the road.
   * LSST collaborators at BNL are trying to run some workflows with PanDA; have been asking for the pilot role in the OSG VO. Mats and I are keeping an eye on them as needed.
   * Progress on the IF and CF annual report sections coming soon. Honest.
