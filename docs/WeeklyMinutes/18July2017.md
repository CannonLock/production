## Announcements: 
 
## Action/Significant Items:
   * PEARC17 Award - Best Software and Data Paper -"Data access for LIGO on the OSG"
   * CMS use is intermittant, oportunistic use is picking up the unused resources.
   * A major Monte-Carlo effort by CMS is in the works, anticipated for mid August.
   * FIFE: unexpectedly low job succes rate, working with experiments to correct.

## Atlas (Armen & Xin)

## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya) 
   * Smooth sailing from an OSG perspective
   * Working with experiments to streamline workflows and improve efficiency
   
## CMS (David)

   * Activity from CMS still expected to be bursty, some data re-reconstructed expected this week and MC production later 
   * Usage numbers down a bit from last week, 6.13M wall hours, 2.9M CPU hours, 238k jobs this week
   * FNAL upgraded its opportunistic CE (USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE3) beginning of this week -- ATLAS jobs seemed to be unaware of the downtime?  ATLAS jobs continued come in up until we had to bring the CE down.
      * FNAL has this week had to schedule an emergency downtime to address a power breaker problem -- number of total slots roughly cut in half from 7AM-3pm CDT on Thursday.  Downtimes are in OIM as of this morning.

   * Release note in preparation
      * Operating system updates, reboots will be required
      
## Production Support (Ken)   
   * CMS still lower than historical average; opportunistic use picking up the slack
   * 7-day average of pilot hours above 4 million (annualized pace of 1.44 B)
   * Waiting on reply about LSST-DESC requests 
   
## Software (Mat)

OSG 3.4.2, 3.3.27 (August):

-   OSG-Configure bugfixes
    -   `osg-configure -v` was not producing a warning on some settings
