## Apologies:

## Atlas (Armen & Xin)
   * ATLAS production status
     * USATLAS total production over the past week was overall stable, at the average level of 65-75K running job slots. There was 1.5 hour DNS and networking outage on the CERN side on Sunday evening, but the production level practically was not affected. 
   * Job Statistics:
     * GRACC: 1.6M pilots, 12.7M walltime hours
     * ATLAS dashboard: 1.6M real jobs (37k on opportunistic resources)
## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya)
   * 28% of all FIFE Jobs 
   * NOvA 573K wall hours
   * MU2E 266K wall hours
   * MicroBooNE 42K wall hours
   * CDF 18K wall hours
   * DES, Darkside, CDMS, DUNE, LARiAT, GM-2 under 10K wall hours
   * Issues with CVMFS at BNL - blacklisted for NOvA and MU2E (https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34178)
   * DUNE jobs are put on hold at MIT, under investigation
   
   
## CMS (David)
   * CMS experiment now taking data from LHC, preparing next round of MC production campaigns. 
   * Utilization this coming week expected to continue to be intermittent, dominated by analysis users preparing for summer conferences this past week.
   * CMS Production for the past 7 days:
      * 6.64 mil wall hours
      * 3.14 mil cpu hours
      * 213k jobs

## Grid Operations Center (Marina)

   * ITB release
      * GRACC: Fixed generation of GRACC summaries for HTCondor jobs that were removed.  Reprocessed old records with this issue as well.
      * Modifications to oasis VM host to allow access to USB ports
      * Update to voms-admin for OSG and mis VOMS (already completed)
      * All services, OS updates, reboots will be required.
   
## Production Support (Ken)   
   
   * DUNE/protoDUNE issue at CERN is indeed asymmetric routing. Trying to cook up a workaround on our end to avoid the redirection that triggers the LHCONE routing. Long term, the best solution is for DUNE and protoDUNE to join LHCONE, which they will most likely do.
   * NOvA and Mu2e had a lot of problems at BNL with getting their CVMFS repos up to date. Seems to be related to getting links set properly when the osgstorage.org repos are also present. Being tracked in : https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34178
