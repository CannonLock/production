## Release (Tim T.)
### Release Schedule

## Security (Jeny)
   * Received a report from Bob Ball (MWT2, AGLT2) about some well-known IPS and IDS as TippingPoint and FortiGuard triggering network blockings during any TLS handshake that contains a client grid proxy (RFC3820). These filters aer targeting a vulnerability in GnuTLS library (CVE-2017-5334). This vulnerability is a double-free in GnuTLS; it allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions by presenting a specially crafted X.509 certificate. 
 Â  * VOMS-Admin new version didn't make it for May release. EGI will hold their public announcement until OSG has a fix/patch for the vulnerabilities in Apache Struts.

## Communication (Kyle)
   * PEARC17 info distribution continues
   * Request has been made to add GRACC to OSG Web Pages - https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/33657 (On the About page?)
