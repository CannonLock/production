## Security (Jeny)
   * WannaCry ransomeware targeting Microsoft Windows systems is over the news. It exploits a vulnerability MS17-010[20] in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. There are worldwide reports and Europe has been affected widely. According to NCSA SecOps, here in the US the news of compromise across US research institutions and universities is particularly sparse.

## Communication (Kyle)
   * PEARC17 communication continues until July. Registration deadlines approaching.
   * In Austin, TX at OSCON last week. Not much to report because of that.
