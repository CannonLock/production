## Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * Production Status:
     * USATLAS total production over the past week was quite stable, at the average level of 65-75K running job slots.
   * Job statistics: 
     * OSG GRACC: 1.7M pilots, 12M walltime hours
     * ATLAS dashboard: 1.6M jobs (33k on opportunistic resources)
     
## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya)

   * NOvA has already exceeded their FY16 wall hours total in FY17 (8.725M vs. 6.831 in all of FY16.)
   * FIFE Experiments totaled 1.232 M opportunistic wall hours this week
   * 32.5% of jobs ran on OSG. Monthly running average exceeds 35%. 
   
## CMS (David)

   * CMS experiment now taking data from LHC, preparing next round of MC production campaigns.
   * Utilization this coming week expected to continue to be intermittent, dominated by analysis users preparing for summer conferences this past week.  There are data rereconstructions in the works to appear this week, larger MC requests in coming weeks.
    CMS Production for the past 7 days:
        7.79 mil wall hours
        3.96 mil cpu hours
        248k jobs

## Production Support (Ken)   

   * GPU test jobs at Syracuse's SUrge cluster have succeeded
   * Software workaround for DUNE/protoDUNE data transfers to/from CERN Tier 0 appears to be working. Longer-term solution in the works.
   * Good flocking week
